                                        The rise of cloud technology has created the perfect environment for Software as a Service (SaaS) to breed and grow, and subsequently, to the rise of SaaS based application development.
                                        In the early days of the internet, we saw examples of the computer industry trying to implement early forms of what are now known as SaaS applications. Companies provided what was then described as Application Service Providers (ASP). These ASPs would allow users to pay for a certain application, 
                                        or applications, by subscribing to them, and then accessing them via a website. However, ASPs never fully managed to catch on, and were often found to be lacking when it came to delivering on their promises of low cost, easy deployment, and easy upgrades.

                                            <h4><b>Advanced Security</b></h4>
                                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Just as important as how well it works, is how well protected it is. Whether it is business data or data belonging to customers, any information collected by a SaaS application will be important and incredibly confidential. As such, it is important to have the proper security protections. </p>
                                        </li>

                                            <h4><b>Scalability</b></h4>
                                            <p style="text-align: justify;"> Any SaaS application also needs the ability to facilitate growth and scale to thousands, sometimes millions of users and billions of transactions. Also, this scale needs to be able to support disruptive innovations, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), IoT, Events-driven IT, and more.  </p>
                                        </li>

                                            <p style="text-align: justify;"> 
                                                Transforming digitally with SaaS application development takes more than your internal team of developers. To move fast and deliver what your business needs you need pre-built, off the shelf apps, components, 
                                                and solutions that you can easily integrate into your existing functionality. It could be something as simple as an eSignature capability or as complex as a custom app to run a batch work to automatically encrypt your sensitive data.
                                                 You need a platform that provides a vast ecosystem for you to benefit from.
